The program asks the user for two numbers and adds them together. te program runs as intended and adds up both numbers that are inputted. It then prints the answer for the user. It successfully asks the user afterward if they want to play again. Adding the data validation at the end of both inputs instead of just one might make it easier to put onto the code. Doing this in a while loop and setting both values to false would prompt the code to tell the user their input was invalid. Other than that the code works as intended! nice job!
